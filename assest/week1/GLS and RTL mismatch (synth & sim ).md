IN This we will look into the synth and simulation mismatch both of the gtkwave will come will be different 



in first image the file name bad_mux is used

now we will see the simulation gtkwave of bad_mux and this we can this y is only change when the sel will change 
and  if i0 and i1 is changing but if sel is out chnage it will not show the change value it shows 
perviously recorded value only

now if we sysnthsis it then it will come prefect if the input is changhing the then the updated 
values we will get here so

there is the mismatch in the simulation and synthasis !!


NOW WE WILL LOOK AT OTHER EXAMPLE
