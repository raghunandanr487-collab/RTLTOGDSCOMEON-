# BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

### what is babysoc?

soc means the system on chip , by the name of it we got to know that all the cpu's,microprocessor,
microcontrollers,memory,I/O ports(input/output),GPU,Digital signal processing all these are present
on the single chip 

### Key Parts of an Soc 

1. CPU(Centeral Processing Unit):
   - it is the brain of the soc ,handling all main instructions and decisions.
   - it manages taks like data processing ,calculation and running application.
   - the flow of the cpu is Microprocessor fetches instruction from memory+Instruction says: “Send 1010101010 to DAC”+CPU writes value to DAC register+DAC converts it to analog output.


2. Memory:
  - there is RAM for temporarily storing data as you use the device.
  - ROM or Flash Storage for keeping inforamtion saved even when device is off.
  - there are EEPROM ,DRAM ,SRAM also and these are the subtypes of the RAM .
  - SRAM structure is used for processor register,where DRAM is used for for main Memory.

3. Graphic Processing Unit(GPU):
  - Responsible for creating visuals on your screen.
  - Used for gaming, watching videos, or any activity involving images or animations.

    
4. I/O Ports(input/output):
  -  Connects the SoC to other parts or devices, like a camera, USB, or even your headphones.
  -  These ports let the SoC send and receive data externally.
