- as we can see here there are the four timing paths and we consdier the timing path as flop clk in/input port and end point - flop d pin/output port

##### 🅰️ Arrival time 

- it means that the signal arrives at which time after the clock edge that lunched it.
- if the clk time period is of 1ns and it arrives at 0.8ns and that 0.8ns is arrival time.
  
##### ®️ Required time 

- the latest time by which the signal must arrive at point to meet the timing reqirnments.
- RT= CLOCK TIME -SETUP TIME .
