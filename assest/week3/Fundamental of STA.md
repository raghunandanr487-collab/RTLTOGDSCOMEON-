- as we can see there are the two ff one is for launch and othe own is for the capture ff
- as we can see here there are the four timing paths and we consdier the timing path as flop clk in/input port and end point - flop d pin/output port

##### 🅰️ Arrival time 

- it means that the signal arrives at which time after the clock edge that lunched it.
- if the clk time period is of 1ns and it arrives at 0.8ns and that 0.8ns is arrival time.
  
#### ®️ Required time 

- the latest time by which the signal must arrive at point to meet the timing reqirnments.
- RT= CLOCK TIME -SETUP TIME .

#### 🏆 Slack
- it is the reqire time - arrival time for the hold analiysis so it should be positive(hold analysis)
- it should be positive ➕ for met timing reqiurnment


#### ♈ hold and setput
- SETUP(max delay) : Latest time by which data must arrive before the next active clock edge
- HOLD(min dealy): Earliest time after the clock edge that data must remain stable



### types of timing analysis
  
  #### 1. 🧜‍♂️ reg to reg
  #### 2. 🐪 in2reg
  #### 3. 🍬 reg2out
  #### 4. 🐼 in2out

## so i hav edone the reg2reg analysis only so now we will see the path based analysis
