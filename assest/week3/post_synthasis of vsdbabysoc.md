 # GLS OF BABYSOC
 
 ## POST-SYNTHESIS SIMULATION 

 - Gate-Level Simulation is performed to validate the functionality of a design after synthesis. Unlike RTL or behavioral simulations, which operate at a higher abstraction level, GLS works on the post-synthesis netlist, containing the actual logic gates and their interconnections used in the final implementation. It ensures that the synthesized design behaves as intended before moving to timing analysis or fabrication.
