# CMOS Inverter 
**Definition:**
The **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter is a graph that shows how the **output voltage changes** when the **input voltage** is increased from 0 to ðŸ”‹ (supply voltage).

It helps us understand how the inverter switches from logic HIGH to logic LOW. When the input is 0 V, the output is at ðŸ”‹ (logic 1), and when the input is at ðŸ”‹, the output becomes 0 V (logic 0). The middle part of the curve shows the transition region where both PMOS and NMOS are active.



  ## so now we will the image of the cmos invertor

   -  as you can this is teh invertor there is pmos and nmos
   -  this transistor will act like the switch when infinite off resistance when vgs<vt


 ##  now we will see the image

- for the condition to on the pmos -vgs<-vt
- and for nmos vgs>vt
- now we will see the another image in which we will see how to on the cmos 
  
## here is the image

-  now if the vin is zero then vin -vdd =-vdd
-  so pmos will get on and nmos will get off
-  if the vin there then noms will get on and pmos will get off

## now we will see the another image in which now it look like when pmos is on and nmos

  - in this we can see that when vin =vdd capacitor is fully charged and direct path exist between vout and vss resulting in vout =0
  - when vin=0 direct path exist between vdd and vout resulting vout=vdd.
    


## now wewill see the image of the graph
