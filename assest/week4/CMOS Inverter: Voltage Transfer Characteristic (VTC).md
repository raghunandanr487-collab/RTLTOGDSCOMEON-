# CMOS Inverter 
**Definition:**
The **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter is a graph that shows how the **output voltage changes** when the **input voltage** is increased from 0 to ðŸ”‹ (supply voltage).

It helps us understand how the inverter switches from logic HIGH to logic LOW. When the input is 0 V, the output is at ðŸ”‹ (logic 1), and when the input is at ðŸ”‹, the output becomes 0 V (logic 0). The middle part of the curve shows the transition region where both PMOS and NMOS are active.



  ## so now we will the image of the cmos invertor

   -  as you can this is teh invertor there is pmos and nmos
   -  this transistor will act like the switch when infinite off resistance when vgs<vt


 ##  now we will see the image

- for the condition to on the pmos -vgs<-vt
- and for nmos vgs>vt
- now we will see the another image in which we will see how to on the cmos 
  
## here is the image

-  now if the vin is zero then vin -vdd =-vdd
-  so pmos will get on and nmos will get off
-  if the vin is  there  at the input  then noms will get on and pmos will get off

## now we will see the another image in which now it look like when pmos is on and nmos

  - in this we can see that when vin =vdd capacitor is fully charged and direct path exist between vout and vss resulting in vout =0
  - when vin=0 direct path exist between vdd and vout resulting vout=vdd.
    


## now we will see the image of the graph

- as we can see the graph on the right side there is graph of pmos and at the left side the
   graph of the nmos
- the nmos graph we have seen previsously whcih is same IDSN VS VDSN
- so in pmos graph we can see that when the -vgs is increasing then neg of IDS  is also increasing
- so now we will convert this graph to another graph that i will shown in the image

  ## so here is the image

 - so here what we have to do that we have wrote the vin=vgs+vdd.
 - on the diif vgs we get the value of vin and then we have make the graph of it
 - graph is still vds vs IDSN but we have taken graph to positive y axis.

   ## now for the further econversion of graph we take it to positive x axis so we will the another image

- in this image we can see we usees the eauation of vout=vdd+vdsp
- after this we get the graph and it shows that capacitor is fully charged when the vin=0
- this called the load curve graph for pmos transistor
- now we will superimpose both the graph and find the vlotage transferr characterstics

- by this grph we will plot the vtc graph by looking at the intersection of the graph


## so the VTC graph will look like this
