# CMOS Inverter 
**Definition:**
The **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter is a graph that shows how the **output voltage changes** when the **input voltage** is increased from 0 to ðŸ”‹ (supply voltage).

It helps us understand how the inverter switches from logic HIGH to logic LOW. When the input is 0 V, the output is at ðŸ”‹ (logic 1), and when the input is at ðŸ”‹, the output becomes 0 V (logic 0). The middle part of the curve shows the transition region where both PMOS and NMOS are active.
