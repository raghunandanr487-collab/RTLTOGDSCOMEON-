# NOISE MARGIN

- Noise Margin is the maximum noise voltage that can be tolerated by a logic circuit without causing an error in the output logic level.
-  there are two types of noise margin

# noise margin high and noise margin low 
 ## Noise Margin High (NMH):
-The maximum noise voltage that can be added to a logic HIGH input without changing the output logic.

## Noise Margin Low (NML):
-The maximum noise voltage that can be added to a logic LOW input without changing the output logic.


### so now we will see the image of the graphs of invertor with labbled vil,voh,vol,vih,vdd

- this is the image in which i have shown the three different graphs in which first one is ideal
  senario.
- second one is more partical senario.
- thrid is the real graph we get.
- In the real graph we can see that now voh is not equal to vdd.


## we can see  other graphs also

- Noise margin high=NMH=VOH​−VIH
- Noise margin low=​NML=VIL​−VOL​


## now we will draw this graph on the stright line

- so we can see there is three different region .
- first region = logic high region ,its diff tells that if that much amout of noise will come then it can bear it and give output as logic one .
- second region = it is the undefined region in which output can either oen or zero.
- thrid region = it is the low region and it  diff tells that if that much amout of noise will     come then it can bear it and give output as logic zero .
