# NOISE MARGIN

- Noise Margin is the maximum noise voltage that can be tolerated by a logic circuit without causing an error in the output logic level.
-  there are two types of noise margin

# noise margin high and noise margin low 
 ## Noise Margin High (NMH):
-The maximum noise voltage that can be added to a logic HIGH input without changing the output logic.

## Noise Margin Low (NML):
-The maximum noise voltage that can be added to a logic LOW input without changing the output logic.


### so now we will see the image of the graphs of invertor with labbled vil,voh,vol,vih,vdd

- this is the image in which i have shown the three different graphs in which first one is ideal
  senario.
- second one is more partical senario.
- thrid is the real graph we get.
- In the real graph we can see that now voh is not equal to vdd.


## we can see  other graphs also

- Noise margin high=NMH=VOH‚Äã‚àíVIH
- Noise margin low=‚ÄãNML=VIL‚Äã‚àíVOL‚Äã


## now we will draw this graph on the stright line

- so we can see there is three different region .
- first region = logic high region ,its diff tells that if that much amout of noise will come then it can bear it and give output as logic one .
- second region = it is the undefined region in which output can either oen or zero.
- thrid region = it is the low region and it  diff tells that if that much amout of noise will     come then it can bear it and give output as logic zero .


## now we will summaries it by looking at the graph

- so for any signal to be considered as logic zero and logic one ,it should be in the NML and  NMH ranges ,respectively

- these are the bumps which are comming ,and other all the thing we clearly see from the image.
  

 # Static behavior evaluation: Cmos invertor robustness

  ## now in this we will see how the NMH and NML will changes when we change the width of pmos
   and nmos 

  ### now we will see the graph of which size nmos and pmos taken 

  <img width="1835" height="984" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 154446" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11679b33-cab9-4ced-a440-bf869ecb0601" />

## Observations 
- From the table, the Noise Margins are: NMH‚Äã=0.3V,NML‚Äã=0.3V
- These values indicate that the inverter can tolerate up to 0.3 V of noise on either the
   logic high or logic-low input without logic error.

- the symmetry of NMH and NML (both =0.3) shows that the inverter is well balanced likely
   because   ùëäp/Lp=Wn/Ln.


## now we willsee the another image in which we have inc the width of pmos and see what happen 

  <img width="1801" height="1067" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 154508" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40574799-a07d-42b1-9969-2332ab67e783" />
