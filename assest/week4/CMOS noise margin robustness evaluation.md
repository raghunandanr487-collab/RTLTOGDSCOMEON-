# NOISE MARGIN

- Noise Margin is the maximum noise voltage that can be tolerated by a logic circuit without causing an error in the output logic level.
-  there are two types of noise margin

# noise margin high and noise margin low 
 ## Noise Margin High (NMH):
-The maximum noise voltage that can be added to a logic HIGH input without changing the output logic.

## Noise Margin Low (NML):
-The maximum noise voltage that can be added to a logic LOW input without changing the output logic.


### so now we will see the image of the graphs of invertor with labbled vil,voh,vol,vih,vdd

- this is the image in which i have shown the three different graphs in which first one is ideal
  senario
- second one is more partical senario
- thrid is the real graph we get .

## we can see  other graphs also
