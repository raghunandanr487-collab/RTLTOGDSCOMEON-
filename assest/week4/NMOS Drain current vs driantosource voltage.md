# Nmos(n channel metal oxide semiconductor)

- N-channel: The channel, which connects the source and drain terminals, is made of N-type
    semiconductor material. 
 - Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor: This describes the transistor's physical structure: a metal gate, an insulating oxide layer (typically silicon dioxide), and a semiconductor substrate. 

- Field-Effect: Its operation is controlled by an electric field, which is generated by the voltage applied to the gate terminal. 

### now we will see the image of an nmos

- so here we can see there is an nmos and here the source and drain are grounded and base also
- here the channel length is l and gate is connected to the metal and after that there is oxide layer and we have used P type semiconductor substrate
- so to make the current flow we have to give some voltage at the gate

 ## now we will see the another image wear gate is positively charged
