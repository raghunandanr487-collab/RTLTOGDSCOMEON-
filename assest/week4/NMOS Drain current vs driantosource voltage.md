# Nmos(n channel metal oxide semiconductor)

- N-channel: The channel, which connects the source and drain terminals, is made of N-type
    semiconductor material. 
-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor: This describes the transistor's physical structure: a metal gate, an insulating oxide layer (typically silicon dioxide), and a semiconductor substrate. 

-Field-Effect: Its operation is controlled by an electric field, which is generated by the voltage applied to the gate terminal. 

### now we will see the image of an nmos

#### so here we can see there is an nmos and here the source and drain are grounded and base also
