# ♒ Nmos(n channel metal oxide semiconductor)

- N-channel: The channel, which connects the source and drain terminals, is made of N-type
    semiconductor material. 
 - Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor: This describes the transistor's physical structure: a metal gate, an insulating oxide layer (typically silicon dioxide), and a semiconductor substrate. 

- Field-Effect: Its operation is controlled by an electric field, which is generated by the voltage applied to the gate terminal. 

### 🪃now we will see the image of an nmos

- so here we can see there is an nmos and here the source and drain are grounded and base also
- here the channel length is l and gate is connected to the metal and after that there is oxide layer and we have used P type semiconductor substrate
- so to make the current flow we have to give some voltage at the gate

 ## 🏹now we will see the another image wear gate is positively charged

- as you can see here gate is positively charged
- and we have the n+ donor atom also which gives the electrons
- so it is a P type subscript so we have to remove the positive charge from  the channel and make the channel completely negatively charged or only electrons show to reach there we have to increase the gate voltage and after that the conditions come called inversion
-  inversion is the process where a sufficiently positive voltage applied to the gate attracts minority electrons to the p-type substrate's surface. 
- the voltage at which the inversion occurs is called the threshold voltage
- so condition is vgs equals to Vt0 for the inversion occur

  ## 🎲 now we will what hapeen if we connect base to positive voltage

 - if we connect bees to positive voltage then inversion will not happen fast or we have to give    more voltage to make the channel
  - inversion not occurs that much fast because the positive charge at base repels the holes
    so we have to give more voltage at vgs to remove the holes from there.
  - so equation will be-

## 🙎‍♂️ now we will connect the train to the positive voltage which is called vds

- as you can see in the image there will be a channel formed also as we keep increasing the vds then there will be a pinch of voltage will come in the play
- so now the equation will become the vgs-vto should be greater than equals to vds
- show as you can see the voltage is not constant through the whole channel  at the source  there will be vgs voltage and at the drain channel there will be vgs-Vto voltage
  
## 🔮 so now there channel is formed and there will be the flow of electron from source to drain and ID will flow from drain to source
- so now we will see the important equations
