- now we will see what happens if we reduce the power supply or in other sens if we reduce the vdd
 so what will happens

- in this image is shown  we have reduce the vdd from 2.5v to 1v keeping the the length and width constsnt

## observations 

- in this we can see we have reduce the vdd
- we have the total six outputs
- so now we will see the advantges and disadvantages
