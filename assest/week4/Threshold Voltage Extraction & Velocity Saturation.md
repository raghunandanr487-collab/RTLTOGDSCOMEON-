 # üß†Threshold Voltage Extraction & Velocity Saturation of NMOS

  - The threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) of an NMOS transistor is the minimum gate-to-source voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>) required to create a conductive inversion
    channel between the source and drain terminals. Below this voltage, the transistor remains in the cutoff region and conducts almost no current.
- Explanation:
 - When a positive voltage is applied to the NMOS gate, it attracts electrons toward the oxide‚Äìsemiconductor interface, forming an inversion layer. The threshold voltage marks the point where this layer becomes strong enough to allow a significant drain current to flow.
The value of V<sub>th</sub> depends on several factors, such as:

- Substrate doping concentration

- Oxide thickness
- Gate material work function
- Body bias (V<sub>SB</sub>)

 # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Velocity Saturation

Definition:
- Velocity saturation occurs when the carrier drift velocity in the MOSFET channel no longer increases linearly with the electric field but instead approaches a maximum saturation velocity (v<sub>sat</sub>) due to scattering effects at high electric fields.
