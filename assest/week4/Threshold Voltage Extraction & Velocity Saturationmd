üß† Threshold Voltage Extraction & Velocity Saturation of NMOS
1Ô∏è‚É£ Threshold Voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) Extraction

Definition:
The threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) of an NMOS transistor is the minimum gate-to-source voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>) required to create a conductive inversion channel between the source and drain terminals. Below this voltage, the transistor remains in the cutoff region and conducts almost no current.

Explanation:
When a positive voltage is applied to the NMOS gate, it attracts electrons toward the oxide‚Äìsemiconductor interface, forming an inversion layer. The threshold voltage marks the point where this layer becomes strong enough to allow a significant drain current to flow.
